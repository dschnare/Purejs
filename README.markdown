Purejs
====================


Installation
--------------------

Copy the source scripts from the 'src' directory or the minified scripts from the 'bin' directory to your project's scripts directory.

The `src/pure.js` file is the source file with inline commenting, and the `bin/pure.min.js` file is the minified obsfucated source file.

To use, simply include one of the scripts via a `<script>` element. The script can be used as an AMD module or a Nodejs/CommonJS module in a modular application as well.
